## About

An app by my group, Parliament, for the ChangeMakers InnoFest Challenge, which improves tourism in Singapore, in a Post-COVID world.

The ChangeMakers InnoFest Challenge 2020 is a make-a-thon competiton for Secondary 2 students in SST. It aims "to seed and nurture a maker and innovative culture in SST, in line with the schoolâ€™s **mission of *nurturing passionate innovators who improve society through real-world applications of science and technology***."

Students will be more "able to appreciate, understand and apply the content and skills acquired in the ChangeMakers' programme, through the creation and presentation of their proposed solutions to the given challenge."

Main Theme: **REThinking the 'new normal' in a post-COVID world**
Sub Themes:
- Public Transportation System
- **Tourism Spots/Places of Interest** (my team's topic)
- Sports & Wellness
- Rethinking spaces and buildings
